# Branding Update

Updated developer credit and related references from 101infotech to Brand Bird.

## Changes

-   `resources/views/layouts/footer.blade.php`
    -   Changed footer text to: "DEVELOPED BY Brand Bird" with link to https://brandbirdagency.com
-   `resources/views/team.blade.php`
    -   Updated company section title and description to Brand Bird
    -   Replaced company logo reference
    -   Updated team member profile link to https://brandbirdagency.com
-   `resources/views/admin/teams.blade.php`
    -   Updated select options and labels from "101infotech" to "Brand Bird"

## Notes

-   Any remaining references in SQL dumps (`sql/danirasdalmoth.sql`) and `.env` mail settings still include 101infotech and are left untouched as they are either historical data or environment-specific. If you want those changed too, let me know and Iâ€™ll update or parameterize them.
