# Migration Error Resolution

## Problem

The Laravel project encountered migration errors when running `php artisan migrate`. The error was:

```
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'daniras.orders' doesn't exist (SQL: alter table `orders` add `ward_no` int not null, add `district` varchar(191) not null)
```

## Root Cause

The project had migration files that attempted to modify tables (`orders`, `teams`, `abouts`) before the tables were actually created. The issue was that there were missing "create table" migration files for these tables, even though the table structures existed in the SQL dump files.

## Solution

Created the missing migration files to establish proper table creation order:

### 1. Created Orders Table Migration

-   **File**: `2021_10_05_170000_create_orders_table.php`
-   **Purpose**: Creates the `orders` table with proper structure
-   **Columns**: id, name, email, phone, address, product_id, quantity, price, status, timestamps

### 2. Created Teams Table Migration

-   **File**: `2021_10_05_180000_create_teams_table.php`
-   **Purpose**: Creates the `teams` table with proper structure
-   **Columns**: id, name, position, phone, address, photo, facebook, instagram, timestamps

### 3. Created Abouts Table Migration

-   **File**: `2021_10_05_160000_create_abouts_table.php`
-   **Purpose**: Creates the `abouts` table with proper structure
-   **Columns**: id, name, address, phone, email, website, facebook, instagram, twitter, ceo_name, ceo_msg, ceo_photo, chairman_name, chairman_msg, chairman_photo, timestamps

### 4. Created Products Table Migration

-   **File**: `2021_10_05_165000_create_products_table.php`
-   **Purpose**: Creates the `products` table with proper structure
-   **Columns**: id, name, photo, description, in_stock, home, retail_price, discount, price, category, brand_name, size, qr_code, qr_path, bar_path, bar_code, bar_number, timestamps

## Migration Order

The migrations now run in the correct order:

1. First: Create base tables (`abouts`, `products`, `orders`, `teams`)
2. Then: Add columns to existing tables
3. Finally: Create additional tables (`jobs`)

## Commands Used

```bash
php artisan migrate:status  # Check migration status
php artisan migrate         # Run pending migrations
```

## Result

All migrations completed successfully:

-   All 13 migration files executed
-   Database tables created with proper structure including products table
-   No more "table not found" errors

## Additional Notes

-   **Update**: Fixed additional "products table not found" error by creating the missing products table migration
-   **Products Table**: Contains e-commerce product data including pricing, inventory status, QR codes, and barcodes

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. Always create "create table" migrations before "alter table" migrations
2. Use proper timestamp prefixes to ensure correct migration order
3. Reference existing SQL dumps to understand required table structures
4. Test migrations in a clean database environment

## Database Connection

The project uses MySQL database:

-   **Host**: 127.0.0.1
-   **Port**: 3306
-   **Database**: daniras
-   **Username**: root
-   **Password**: (empty)
